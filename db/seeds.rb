# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:
#Post.delete_all
#Post.create!( id: 1, title: "This is a post", link: "www.google.com", description: "This is the post description", project_type: 0, user_id: 1)
